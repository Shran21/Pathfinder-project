# Pathfinder-project
 The project aims to implement USMT in a user-friendly manner, including the migration of local user profiles and AD accounts. Emphasis is placed on simplicity.
The User State Migration Tool (USMT) is a Microsoft tool designed to facilitate the migration of user profiles and associated data from one version of Windows operating system to another. With USMT, user settings, documents, pictures, music files, and other personal data important to the user can be easily transferred.

USMT enables system administrators to efficiently manage user data migration in organizational networks or mass deployment environments, minimizing workforce requirements and ensuring seamless transition to the new version of the operating system.

USMT is a built-in component of Windows operating systems and provides a command-line interface for executing migration tasks.

Example of Using USMT with PowerShell:

# Create folder for USMT files
```
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "C:\USMT"
```
# Execute USMT command to export user data
```
.\ScanState.exe C:\USMT\MigrationStore /i:MigUser.xml /i:MigApp.xml
```
# Execute USMT command to import user data
```
.\LoadState.exe C:\USMT\MigrationStore /i:MigUser.xml /i:MigApp.xml
```
This example creates a folder for USMT files and then runs USMT commands to export and import data. The MigUser.xml and MigApp.xml files contain migration settings and are part of the USMT configuration.
